HR_Metrics_Report_sample 
I created the HR Metrics Report to provide a clear, visual overview of key workforce trends. The Total Employees Volume Trend tracks headcount changes over time, while the Gender Headcount Volume Trend helps assess gender diversity in the company. The Employee Headcount by Country shows where our workforce is concentrated globally, and the Employee Headcount by Age Group highlights generational diversity. I also included Employee Headcount by Positions to examine role distribution and Employee Headcount by Business Unit to visualize staffing across departments. This dashboard is an essential tool for HR leaders to track trends, enhance diversity, and optimize resource allocation.
